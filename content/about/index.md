ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name is Morgan. I am an [American New Zealander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_New_Zealanders) living in [Bellingham, Washington State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington). 

I have been programming for approximately 5.5+ years after picking up developer skills as a career changer from law. I have worked on programs that are relied upon chairside by Orthodontists to provide real time information about their case. I have made front end features used in the websites of a Fortune 500 company. I have managed volunteers in my spare time for non-profits. I am confident enough to say I have things to offer the right opportunity.

I worked at the start-up [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com/) based out of Atlanta, GA for 4+ years focusing on the web for that company. I most recently have worked at [WompMobile](https://www.wompmobile.com/) focusing on web development also.

Before returning to the USA in 2016 I graduated with an [LLB](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/llb.html)/[BA](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/subjects/clas.html) from the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/). I became an [enrolled barrister and solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/starting-as-a-lawyer/admitted-but-no-practising-certificate/) on March 30th, 2015 at the [High Court in Dunedin, New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_Law_Courts).

When I returned to the USA in 2016 I considered for a while trying to practice law in the state of [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)) (where I was born and lived 1989-1997 and then briefly in 2016) - [likely requiring further education and a waiver](https://www.gabaradmissions.org/waiver-process) - but I turned against the idea and moved towards doing software instead. I haven't looked back since. 

I enjoy art, reading and a little bit of dark European/[New Zealand](https://www.nomdstore.com/us/) style fashion particularly from Dunedin. I wear a lot of black and drink a lot of coffee. My development philosophy is influenced by [continuous improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen).
