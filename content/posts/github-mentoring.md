## Spoiler: It is not all about the graph

I am biased. We all are. My bias towards Github comes from experience: My github profile was essential in getting a job. I applied for quite a few jobs and then when I got an interview I was asked about stuff on my Github. I answered questions and talked about my projects. I got the job. If I didnt have my github, I don't know if I would have got my current job.

__One major win this year has been mentoring up and coming developers about how to optimize their Github!__





##   I figured I would start with some testimonials:

>It really was excellent opinionated advice,  I would encourage others to reach out especially if you're like me, and unsure of what to do to break into the field. That 20-30 minutes was quite the confidence booster 

- Andrew Z

>Thank you for looking at mine, Morgan. I also encourage folks to chat him up for some advice 

- Josh F

>Just met with Morgan, who shared many useful insights. I highly recommend it if any other aspiring developers have the opportunity. Thanks, Morgan!

 - Simon

> Thank you so much for sharing your insight and advice. It’s awesome that you’re doing this. Every little thing you suggested was incredibly helpful. I’ve started making some improvements and there’s a lot more I still want to do based on your suggestions 

- Russel T

> Directed guidance and loads of information. Thanks for the mentoring @morganm . Now to get started on that homework! Can’t thank you enough 

- Aaron

> Just got off of a zoom mentoring session with @morganm. He had a ton of practical, actionable advice which I intend to put into practice asap. I feel super fortunate to have found bellingham.codes and Morgan and the rest of the helpful, friendly folks on here. Thanks again, Morgan!
