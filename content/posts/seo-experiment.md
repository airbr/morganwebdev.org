# There is a concept in SEO that link farms are bad. But what about Tags from a static site generator?

## I am adding a bunch of Tags to this post and seeing how it affects the site, If you found your way here from a tag, I welcome you.

## These tags were mostly taken from my [public pinboard account](https://pinboard.in/u:airbr/public/)
