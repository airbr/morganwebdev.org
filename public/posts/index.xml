      <description>There is a concept in SEO that link farms are bad. But what about Tags from a static site generator? I am adding a bunch of Tags to this post and seeing how it affects the site, If you found your way here from a tag, I welcome you. These tags were mostly taken from my public pinboard account </description>

      <description>This is a small blog about how I pared down my personal website to a single page of HTML bundled with parcel.js. This was a change from a PWA Vue-CLI generated site using Webpack. I write this to express my appreciation of making maintenance easy and simplicity where possible.

What I want out of a personal website or &amp;lsquo;my personal bag of hyperlinks&amp;rsquo;. I want people to be able to click and find almost my entire web presence linked from one place on mobile or desktop.</description>

      <description>Over the course of 2020 and 2021 thus far I have mentored seven up and coming software developers from several communities: Bellingham Codes, Tech404 and Linkedin. I mentored them to optimize their GitHub account for prospective employers/recruiters/OSS opportunities. I spent 20-40mins over Zoom with each of them and learned a lot myself about what it is like getting started in the industry today. As of writing this, I am aware that one person has landed a job and one has advanced in interview stages aided by their GitHub.</description>

      <description>TLDR; I survived 2020 and managed a few wins What a year. What an incredible, awful, moving, emotional, massive year just to name a few adjectives.
I have had a lot of time on the computer this year. I have put in a lot of work as a distraction. Despite everything I managed a few wins this year. I figure I would focus on them to celebrate a little in general and celebrate this blog and the topics I may explore in the posts to come:</description>

      <description>Introduction to my new blog Hello. This is the first blog post on my deceptively simple new Hugo blog. I am using the Cactus Theme on Github with just a few modifications.
I really like a bunch of things about Hugo. Notably I was able to get started insanely fast without feeling like I was downloading a mountain of dependencies with NPM like when I tried (successfully, after much tooling around) to set up a blog with Gatsby.</description>
