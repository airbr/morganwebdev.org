      <description>Introduction to my new blog Hello. This is the first blog post on my deceptively simple new Hugo blog. I am using the Cactus Theme on Github with just a few modifications.
I really like a bunch of things about Hugo. Notably I was able to get started insanely fast without feeling like I was downloading a mountain of dependencies with NPM like when I tried (successfully, after much tooling around) to set up a blog with Gatsby.</description>

      <description>TLDR; I survived 2020 and managed a few wins What a year. What an incredible, awful, moving, emotional, massive year just to name a few adjectives. As of writing this post I am fortunate to have avoided catching COVID-19 through a combination of luck and social distancing and other precautions I have taken consistently since March. Vaccines are being rolled out across the world and can&amp;rsquo;t come soon enough to as many people as possible.</description>
