      <description>I am enamored with Playwright. End to end integration testing is a huge topic but I can tell you just a few things about my experience from helping to integrate JavaScript E2E tests at work and in my spare time projects:

      <description>Over the course of 2020 and 2021 thus far I have mentored seven up and coming software developers from several communities: Bellingham Codes, Tech404 and Linkedin. I mentored them to optimize their GitHub account for prospective employers/recruiters/OSS opportunities. I spent 20-40mins over Zoom with each of them and learned a lot myself about what it is like getting started in the industry today. As of writing this, I am aware that one person has landed a job and one has advanced in interview stages aided by their GitHub.</description>

      <description>TLDR; I survived 2020 and managed a few wins What a year. What an incredible, awful, moving, emotional, massive year just to name a few adjectives.
I have had a lot of time on the computer this year. I have put in a lot of work as a distraction. Despite everything I managed a few wins this year. I figure I would focus on them to celebrate a little in general and celebrate this blog and the topics I may explore in the posts to come:</description>
